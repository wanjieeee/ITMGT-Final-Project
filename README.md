# ITMGT Final Project 
**This GitHub repository serves as the final submission of Group 12 for our ITMGT Project.**

## Introduction
There is a clear distinction between code that works and code that creates a playable experience. This is the primary lesson and concept we all have learned throughout this coding journey. 

As chess players ourselves, playing thousands of games on websites like lichess.org and chess.com, we've wondered how these websites successfully created a platform for its players to play chess digitally, contrary to its nature as a traditionally renowned board game. But we saw the potential of creating it ourselves by conceptualizing the game into a form of code using our knowledge in python. By allowing ourselves to see through the board as a series of rows and column, attributing chess pieces as a variable, and implementing the chess rules using code, we knew that it was possible. 

By creating a simple offline chess game using python, allowing two individuals to play chess using a single laptop and computer, we continued to pursue this game development project. 

## Python Chess Game
This is a program that runs a chess game using only Python using its **pygame** library.

### Requirements
To start this project, it required us these three important components:
* Python (duh)
* pygame (using pip install pygame)
* A code editor like VS Code and Sublime Text

### What's Inside
This simple chess platform has the following features:
* A main menu showing the "Chess" title, with "play" and "exit" button.
* A playable chess board with its pieces
* A 10-minute clock for black and white
* A winner screen, showing the victor via checkmate or by time.
* A "play again" button to restart the game.
